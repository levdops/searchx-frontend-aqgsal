        <p> Imagine you are a reporter for a newspaper. Your editor has just told you to write a story about <font color="#33BEFF"> <strong>{title}</strong></font> together with a group of colleagues. 
        Before writing the story, your editor called for meeting, and asked you and your colleagues to collect in 10 minutes materials that will support writing the story. </p>
        <p> Your group distributes the work by splitting the task into two subtasks: (1) finding useful documents and (2) examining them in detail. </p>
        <p> Your job is to identify as many documents (news articles) as possible that appear on first sight to be useful (considering different aspects of <font color="#33BEFF"> <strong>{title}</strong> </font>)  for the task at hand. As you save the documents, they will be shared with your colleagues. Your colleagues will be examining the saved documents carefully, refining the list of documents as they find necessary. The final list will be shared with your editor during the meeting. </p>
